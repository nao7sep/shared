## todo

- branch management best practices
- check all existing tasks to draw a bigger picture. currently work is in bits
- tool to compress/extract entire code directory, while gitignoring things
- clone repos on mac mini
- minimal .gitignore in 2 repos
- relearn markdown syntax AND make or find cheat sheet
- check all remaining tasks in paper notebook
- discuss task management cost and its potential relevance to inability to complete trivial tasks (such as pushups)
- .command files to update homebrew/pip packages
- consider replacing _private in docs with "secrets"

### done

- commit initial docs by claude AND the conv log => just the docs
- beyond compare on macbook as well

### declined

- tool to save/restore latest claude conversation log => accountability issue. if we edit logs, we corrupt integrity. if we dont, we'll expose a lot of garbage
- tool to view conv logs => if good docs are generated/reviewed, conv logs add no value

## tips

- notes, conv logs, etc must be concise. we rarely refer to redundant ones
- directory structure is not just classification and must help us recall context
