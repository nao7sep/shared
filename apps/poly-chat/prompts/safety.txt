Analyze this content for safety and security concerns.

CHECK FOR:
Scan thoroughly for sensitive information and security issues:

- Personal information (PII): names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, SSNs, birthdates, passport numbers
- Secrets and credentials: API keys, passwords, tokens, OAuth secrets, access keys, private keys, database passwords
- Financial data: credit card numbers, bank account numbers, routing numbers, transaction details, payment information
- Confidential information: proprietary business data, trade secrets, internal documents, unreleased plans
- Offensive content: hate speech, discriminatory language, explicit sexual content, violent threats
- Health information: medical records, diagnoses, health conditions, treatments, patient data

For code and technical content, also check for:
- Hardcoded credentials (example: const API_KEY = "sk-proj-abc123...")
- Connection strings (example: postgres://user:password@hostname/database)
- Infrastructure details (example: internal IPs like 10.0.1.45, server names, deployment credentials)
- Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection patterns, XSS code, exposed endpoints)

Categorize technical/code concerns under Secrets (credentials, keys) or Confidential (infrastructure, internal details).

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:

Personal:     ✅ None
Secrets:      ✅ None
Financial:    ✅ None
Confidential: ✅ None
Offensive:    ✅ None
