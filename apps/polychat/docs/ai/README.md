i had some ai related documents generated by gemini deep research and thought that's it.

now a few days later i am adding one more. then, i should leave a note for context. otherwise, i'll quickly forget what was for what.

i'll keep the docs in a subdirectory of polychat project for now. they were generated for polychat's ai providers. they dont cover everything. multi-modality for example is hardly covered. the docs here should be a good start for new ai providers, though.

## anthropic

- anthropic-python-sdk-guide.md (2026-02, japanese)
- anthropic-sdk-reference.md (2026-02, english)

due to my browser/computer language settings being japanese or some internet accesses originating from a japanese ip address, gemini deep research happened to collect dozens of pages in japanese. my prompt was in english, but the result came out in japanese. i regenerated in english. i'm not sure which is better. part of me feels japanese version is more comprehensive. so i'm keeping both. ais can handle them instantly.

## openai

- openai-integration-patterns-2026.md (2026-02, mixed)
- openai-integration-guide.md (2026-02, chat completions)

first one came out with responses api related info. at that time, i was designing polychat with legacy chat completions api (for consistency with other openai-compatible ai providers). i regenerated, asking gemini deep research to focus on chat completions.

- openai-responses-api-guide.md (2026-02, responses api)
- https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text

a few days later today, to implement web search feature, i am switching to responses api. i generated one more. it looks good enough, but some info is missing. together with the official page's content, we'll probably get a good prompt. so, i'm leaving a note. (i actually made one more with the content pre-merged, but ais would implement/review better with 2 individual materials provided).

## gemini

- google-genai-reference.md (2026-02)

not the deprecated "google-generativeai" package. we must always specific "google-genai". ais are often confused.

## grok, mistral, perplexity, deepseek x openai compatibility

- xai-grok-openai-integration.md (2026-02)
- mistral-openai-integration.md (2026-02)
- perplexity-api-guide.md (2026-02)
- deepseek-api-integration.md (2026-02)

there must be much more that these ais can do if we use their official packages, but that would be scope creep. maybe next time.

- https://github.com/xai-org/xai-sdk-python
- https://github.com/mistralai/client-python
- https://github.com/perplexityai/perplexity-py
- none seemingly available for deepseek as of 2026-02

## web search

- polychat-providers-copilot-analysis.md (2026-02-10)
- claude-ai-provider-search-features-2026.md (2026-02-10)
- polychat-provider-search-codex-2026-02-09.md (2026-02-10)
- ai-providers-search-gemini.md (2026-02-10)

initial notes regarding 7 ais' web search support. i used copilot (claude sonnet 4.5), claude (the same), codex (gpt-5.3-codex medium) and gemini (gemini 3 pro or flash).

based on these, claude opus 4.6 generated:

- plans/web-search-implementation-plan.md (2026-02-10)
- plans/web-search-implementation-context.md (2026-02-10)

i also had this generated by claude code (sonnet 4.5):

- perplexity-citations-streaming.md (2026-02-10)

perplexity searches by default and returns citations, but ais didnt know how to extract them.

## legacy

- provider-guide.md (2026-02)

very first document. after claude sonnet 4.5 generated the 7 ai providers with its cut-off knowledge, i had this generated to add timeout/retry support, better error handling and edge case handling. the document did its job, but a lot of things were missing/incomplete. so, i generated ai-specific documents and updated the code.
