## History

### 2026-02-02
- ❌ branch management best practices => my knowledge is enough for now
- ✅ discuss task management cost and its potential relevance to inability to complete trivial tasks (such as pushups) => done. i will think of something
- ❌ tool to compress/extract entire code directory, while gitignoring things => branches work better/faster
- ✅ tk: faster way to show recent tasks. "h" currently shows everything => added today, yesterday and recent commands
- ✅ tk: use emojis in history

### 2026-02-01
- ✅ practice writing the what, following 01 doc => wrote what.md and also work_log.md for tk
- ✅ establish straightforward workflow. inbox zero strategy may be key => wrote tk
- ✅ simple todo management cli tool that works well with git and inbox zero strategy => name of app is tk
- ❌ update HOW.md of tk => source is now single source of truth
- ✅ what's python's Protocol? => interface-ish feature without inheritance
- ✅ sqlalchemy? => entity framework-ish orm. also has dapper-ish lower level features

### 2026-01-30
- ✅ commit initial docs by claude AND the conv log => just the docs
- ✅ beyond compare on macbook as well
- ✅ minimal .gitignore in 2 repos
- ✅ consider replacing _private in docs with secrets => replaced and refactored
- ✅ clone repos on mac mini
- ✅ generate doc on python dependency management
- ✅ what is .zprofile? check it on all pcs => unsuitable for setting api keys as environment variables. plaintext. exposed to all processes. use keychain
- ✅ system-wide python3 is used and poetry isnt found on macbook => fixed
- ✅ make sure poetry is installed via homebrew on all pcs
- ✅ .command files to update homebrew/pip packages AND ones that run ai clis => first half done. second half violates yagni
- ✅ license for the repos and apps that they will contain => gpl good enough
- ❌ generate doc on commonly used metadata => saved in secrets repo
- ❌ tool to view conv logs => if good docs are generated/reviewed, conv logs add no value
- ❌ relearn markdown syntax AND make or find cheat sheet => i seem to know just enough
