## History

### 2026-02-01
- [x] practice writing the what, following 01 doc => wrote what.md and also work_log.md for tk
- [x] establish straightforward workflow. inbox zero strategy may be key => wrote tk
- [x] simple todo management cli tool that works well with git and inbox zero strategy => name of app is tk
- [~] update HOW.md of tk => source is now single source of truth

### 2026-01-30
- [x] commit initial docs by claude AND the conv log => just the docs
- [x] beyond compare on macbook as well
- [x] minimal .gitignore in 2 repos
- [x] consider replacing _private in docs with secrets => replaced and refactored
- [x] clone repos on mac mini
- [x] generate doc on python dependency management
- [x] what is .zprofile? check it on all pcs => unsuitable for setting api keys as environment variables. plaintext. exposed to all processes. use keychain
- [x] system-wide python3 is used and poetry isnt found on macbook => fixed
- [x] make sure poetry is installed via homebrew on all pcs
- [x] .command files to update homebrew/pip packages AND ones that run ai clis => first half done. second half violates yagni
- [x] license for the repos and apps that they will contain => gpl good enough
- [~] generate doc on commonly used metadata => saved in secrets repo
- [~] tool to view conv logs => if good docs are generated/reviewed, conv logs add no value
- [~] relearn markdown syntax AND make or find cheat sheet => i seem to know just enough
